Algorithm - Basic operations

Start

Declare integer variables first, second, add, sub, multiply, divide, and divide2.

Assign the value 5 to the variable first.

Assign the value 4 to the variable second.

Perform the addition operation:

Add the values of first and second.
Store the result in the add variable.
Perform the subtraction operation:

Subtract the value of second from the value of first.
Store the result in the sub variable.
Perform the multiplication operation:

Multiply the values of first and second.
Store the result in the multiply variable.
Perform the division operation:

Divide the value of first by the value of second.
Store the result in the divide variable.
Perform the modulo operation:

Calculate the remainder when first is divided by second.
Store the result in the divide2 variable.
Print the result of the addition operation (add) followed by a newline.

Print the result of the subtraction operation (sub) followed by a newline.

Print the result of the multiplication operation (multiply) followed by a newline.

Print the result of the division operation (divide) followed by a newline.

Print the result of the modulo operation (divide2) followed by a newline.
